<h1><u> Background </u></h1>
<p> The ratio of parks to people matters. Having more parks brings many benefits to a community like the South Bronx. Parks bring more greenery to an area, it can make people want to be cleaner and more active, it can also help with air quality since there would be more trees. Parks are extremely important when it comes to a community that can be slightly over populated as well. According to Ari Phillips author of <a href='http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/10/09/3574768/battle-for-new-york-green-space/'target="_blank">'Environmental Racism' </a>And The Fight For Green Space In The Bronx", "recent urban renewal projects in New York City that feature green space, such as the High Line Park in Lower West Side, Manhattan or the Brooklyn Bridge Park... are a valuable asset to the communities they inhabit. They entice businesses, improve quality of life for residents, and offer tangible environmental benefits, including storm surge buffers..."</p>
<p> The causes of asthma are stil unknown. Asthma could be either genetic or caused by environmental factors. According to the <a href='https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma/causes'target="_blank"> National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>, "Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe)</li>
  <li>Parents who have asthma</li>
  <li>Certain respiratory infections during childhood</li>
<li>Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing</li>

<p>If asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air."<p>
</ul>
  <p>Asthma is a human problem seen in environments like that of the South Bronx with poor air quality. By having more parks, and things that bring benefit to the environment, problems like Asthma could be diminished.</p>
  
  <p> Air quality changes over time. One day the quality can be strong and another day it can be poor. Data for air quality can change because of season and weather factors. As the weather and temperature changes each day, our scientifical experiment data can be skewed. According to <a href='http://www.bcairquality.ca/climate-change/'target="_blank"> British Columbia</a>, "causes are...the release of air pollutants from a variety of sources and activities. Fossil fuel burning is the major source... Taking actions to reduce the pollution from fossil fuel burning will help improve air quality..." The time to collect the data is limited as well.</p>
 
<p>By collecting air quality in our community we can be able to compare it to the air quality in other communities around the city that get more benefits. For example the air quality in St. Mary's Park must be poorer than that of the air quality in Central Park.</p>

        <p> I see a pattern in the pins "5V" and "GND" when it comes to building circuits so I used those pins and connected it to a positive and negative like how I seen it previously be done. Then I know I have to connect my sensor to the breadboard so I connected it all to a random D value. </p>
